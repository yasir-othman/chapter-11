routing is topic that you need to know about, so in order for thee computer to 
connect to the inter net they must have unique 
address, the ip address it should be anumber between 0-255
when you connect to the internet through the ISP you usually assigned to temp IP address
for the duration of connection but you will have parment IP addres if you
connected to a LAN when you connect to the inter net DHCP domane name config protocol
will assigne ip address to the computer.
the domain name system (DNS), responsible for translate the hostnname in to IP address 
DNS server also know as nameserver. the DNS in each device knows the minimum requirement 
regard the tree and subtrees, when your computer asks for an ip address acutally first
it asks the root server where to find the 
a DNS for .org,then asks the .org for an ip address. also the routers are know their ways to trasnffer packets
around the network using over fast link, also they know if the destination device dropped of the network.
there is two level lower level deals with IP address for source and destination,
and upper level TCP, resposible about about negotiation 
between two machines. which is reliable because it based on send and recieve acknolodegements
